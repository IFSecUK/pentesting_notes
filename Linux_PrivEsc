#First do local box enumeration
	1. uname -a: print out all information about the system such as distro type and version.

	2. ~/.bash_history: If you have read permissions, then look into this file.
	
	3. .bash_profile and .bashrc: contains shell commands that are run when bash is invoked. These files can contain some interesting start up setting that can potentially reveal us some infromation. For example a bash alias can be pointed towards an important file or process.

	4. sudo -V: shows sudo version.
	5. sudo -l: list binaries which can be run with sudo permissions.

	#Check whether /etc/ directory is writable
	1. Read /etc/passwd - for enumeration of user accounts
	2. Read /etc/shadow - If possible - contains hashes for users.
	3. Read /etc/hosts - to enumerate network further.

	#Check cronjobs if there are running any
	>cat /etc/crontab

	#Find command and interesting files
	-> find / -type f -name "" 2>/dev/null
	-> Look for .log, .bak, .conf files and other some important files.

	#SUID
	>find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null

	#TCP connections
	>netstat -at | less
	>netstat -tulpn: will provide much nice output with the most-interesting data.
