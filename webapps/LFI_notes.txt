What is LFI?
	-> Local File Inclusion(LFI) is the vulnerability that is mostly found in web servers. This vuln is 
	exploited when a user input contains a certain path to the file which might be present on the server 		and will be included in the output. This kind of vuln can be used to read files containing sensitive 
	and confidential data from the vuln system.
	-> Defense is Proper sanitization of user input.
	-> It is a type of vul commonly found in PHP based websites but isint restricted to them.
	
How to find LFI?
	-> To test for LFI what we need is a parameter on any URL or any other input fields like request body
	etc. For example, if the website is tryhackme.com then a parameter in the URL can look like 
	https://tryhackme.com?file=robots.txt. Here file is the parameter.

Exploiting LFI:
	-> Once we find the vulnerable parameter, we can include the passwd file on the Linux system.
	-> Or check out for other interesting files.
		-> check out in /opt directory for WebApp_Payloads and go to LFI
