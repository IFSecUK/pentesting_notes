#NFS shares
Port 111 - RPC

Rpcbind can help us look for NFS-shares. So look out for nfs. Obtain list of services running with RPC:
>rpcbind -p <targetip>
>rpcinfo -p <targetip>

#List NFS shares
	>showmount -e <targetIP>

#Mount the available share to your machine
	>mkdir /tmp/nfs
	>mount -t nfs <targetIP>:Share /tmp/nfs/ -nolock
		# -t nfs: type of device to mount, then specifying that its nfs
		# -nolock: specifies not to use NLM locking.
