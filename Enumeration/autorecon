Usage:
	>autorecon [target]
		-> Target can be a single machine or can be used with CIDR notation or resolvable hostnames.
		Useful switches:
			1. -t [input file] - targets one each line
			2. -ct [number] - Default is 5. The number of targets you want to scan concurrently.
			3. -cs [number] - concurrent scans per target - default is 10.
				-> no need to change this number.
			4. -o [output dir] - directory name to output to.
			5. -v - verbosity level. -vv will increase the verbosity level. generally -v is only recommended.

Example:
	>autorecon 127.0.0.1

	-> By default it will create a results directory in the current directory in which the output will be present. Specify -o if you want to save it somewhere else.


Note: You can change the default wordlists used to bruteforce the services by editing the 'service-scans-default.toml' config file.
