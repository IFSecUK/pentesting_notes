Applocker: AppLocker is an application whitelisting technology introduced with Windows 7. It allows restricting which programs users can execute based on the programs path, publisher and hash.

	-> There are many ways of bypassing applocker:
		1. If AppLocker is configured with default AppLocker rules, we can bypass it by placing our executable in the following directory: C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color - This is whitelisted by default. 

ConsoleHost_history:
	Just like Linux bash, Windows powershell saves all previous commands into a file called ConsoleHost_history. This is located at %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
